<p>    East County</p><p>    San Diego is perhaps one of California’s most distinctive cities as well as its most important municipality. A huge Metropolis that has the pleasure of    being the West Coast's first slap together bay. The Spaniards landed in San Diego on 1542, this land being their first incursion into regions north of    Mexico. Since then, The San Diego Government has pledged allegiance to three different flags; the Crown of the Kings of Spain; The new Mexican nation after    its defection from the monarchy; and finally, post-Mexican-American war, the US’s smartly designed stars and banners.</p><p>    San Diego has easily become one of the most transient spots on the great beast that is the US. Its proximity to the Mexican Border, its cobwebbed tapestry    of highways plus its humongous port, have gifted it with a lively commerce trade and mercantile color few other centers have managed to garner. This onto    itself has had the added bonus of galvanizing the societal makeup; its many citizens demanding a certain level of amenities, regional flavors and tax    bought perks.</p><p>    San Diego and its many suburbs are an integral part of Californian politics and budding economy. It's right up there, on an even stepping stool next, to    Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p><p>    As, an added bonus, San Diego’s strategic value has always been of grave importance to the nation. Such was the case, that on the last days of the Second    World War, the Empire of Japan had hand picked the region for a daring biological attack above all other US coastal towns of the area. A wacky plan,    averted by the dropping of the bomb and the Emperor’s total surrender, that constituted kamikaze dives with plane stocked up on fleas infected with the    Black Plague. San Diego's stature of the gateway to the orient and the Pacific an immense spot of pride for its citizens.</p><p>    A magnificent city, a titan, that dominates all its other west coast brothers.</p><p>    East County, just a skip or two from its bustling port and downtown seems a spot that constantly treads the line between the urban and the wild. Between    the modern and the old. Between a computer and an the abacus. Dozens upon dozens of communities and towns that seem plucked straight out of a fairy tale or    a Wild West Adventure.</p><p>    Some more historic and savage, more cowboy in their ways, others more tranquil and passive. The one thing the all hold in common, the only line the all    share, that genetical marker that makes them brothers is their sweeping vistas, their abundantly magnificent nature and their good natured neighbors.</p><p>    <strong>Weather</strong></p><p>    East County has a number of ecosystems and micro climates. Each place playing with its very own weather patterns. Up by its more north-eastern latitudes,    in its mountainous regions like Mount Laguna, Palomar Mountain, Pine Valley and Julian, snow is a constant gift come winter. Meanwhile, down by the border    with Mexico, a dry atmosphere promotes longevity and health. Its volcanic regions presenting its citizens with dozens of hot springs (Jacumba) mild winters    and dry hot summers.</p><p>    <strong>Recreation</strong></p><p>    East County holds all kinds of recreational activities.

Jacumba is a    <a target="_blank" href="http://jacumbaresort.com/">hot spring/spa</a> community. Tecate and Portero, right next to the Mexican border, are hot beds of good “Amigos” andblock parties. Alpine and El Cajon, not only have excellent state parks, but they also share a couple of Native American Reservations as well as a    <a target="_blank" href="http://viejas.com/">Casino or two</a>.

And Pine Valley is famously known for being a stock photo capital as well as a preferred honeymoon destination, mostly due    on account of its unsurpassable of its natural beauty.</p><p>    <strong>Shopping</strong></p><p>    The farther east you travel, the harder it is to find a big-box store or a shopping mall. Once you past Alpine, you’ll have no other choice but to embrace    the joys of a General Store, a couple of Fashion Boutiques and the obligatory souvenir shops in this town that caters to jet-setter (Julian).</p><p>    <strong>Restaurants</strong></p><p>    Dining in East County is a harried affair. Some towns, like La Mesa, Lakeside, Spring Valley, Alpine, Del Cerro and El Cajon have the culinary catalogue of    New York and Chicago; nothing is too exotic or off limits. Meanwhile other places, remote and secluded, make due with an excellent diner or two, a smashing    grill and a honky tonk bar. Some, have even acquired a certain level of fame due to its one IT, that has somehow landed that small region on every food    critics must taste list before you die, for example: Santa Ysabel’s Pie’s at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/">Julian Pie Company</a>; Tecate’s mix Michelada    (Miller and Tecate beer from Mexico, with a special brand of “caliente” sauce); Julian’s apple cider (made from apples cultivated in the land since the    turn of the 20th century) .</p><p>    <strong>Nightlife</strong></p><p>    East County’s nightlife is nothing to write home about.

It is a tranquil community that cherishes its seclusion and quiet    ways. The sort of spot where your neighbors interest revolve around the trivial things in life; walking their four legged best friend, barbecuing come    sundown, sharing a bottle of Jack with their buddies, or simply hiking up to the summit of Cowles Mountain and basking twilight descent into their hamlet.</p><p>    Santa Ysabel</p><p>    Snuggled in the tight borders of an idilic valley, Santa Ysabel was one of the Spaniard’s primary spots for indoctrination of the local native people of    North America. After the Conquistadors trampled through the land and the Crown laid claimed to all it could seize, the next stage of colonization was to    domesticate and make docile the indigenous people of California.</p><p>    For this last purpose it sought-out the church’s help. It began to immigrate Franciscan monks and clergymen to “Las California” provinces of the    Viceroyalty of New Spain. For this purpose, it started setting up a route of missions all across the region. “Santa Ysabel Asistencia", a sub-station of    the much grander Mission San Diego de Alcalá opened its doors in 1818.</p><p>    For almost 30 years, the status quo remained the same, until Mexico, once the Spaniards vacated the premises, bequeathed José Joaquín Ortega and Eduardo    Stokes with a rather large land grant that included the mission as well as most of the surrounding countryside.</p><p>    After the America/Mexican war and the end of the Civil War, the United States once more had a moment of respite to look out unto the west and start    constructing what would eventually be San Diego proper.</p><p>    Grabbing hold of the opportunity, C.R. Wellington constructed a general store in what would eventually become the town of Santa Ysabel. By 1889, his gamble    had paid off… The Store had grown and the district had acquired a hotel, a postoffice and a blacksmith.</p><p>    The town serves as a gateway to the mountains of San Diego County, including the Laguna Mountains and Julian, and Palomar Mountain.</p><p>    <strong>Weather</strong></p><p>    The Mediterranean atmosphere of the whole San Diego area is one of the best and healthiest ecosystems in all of the United States. Santa Ysabel has been    blessed with being one of the many awarded this spectacular system. Summers are warm, yet dry while Winters are mild and stable. Precipitation occurs only    in the months between November and March. Allergy season doesn’t even factor in. Recent data has discovered that this sort of atmosphere promotes    longevity; humidity and temperature fluctuations being the bane of a healthy system.</p><p>    <strong>Recreation</strong></p><p>    Santa Ysabel is a small community who gets its kicks and licks playing around the majestic beauty of its surroundings.On every horizon, on every corner,    down every country road adventure awaits. Hiking, running, picnics, horseback riding, ATVs and motocross…The main in Santa Ysabel is that off-road, is just    another way of saying fun.</p><p>    <strong>Shopping</strong></p><p>    Santa Ysabel loves and appreciates its uniquely quaint and overly homely demeanor. Its disdains such big city fare as brand stores and big box    monstrosities, and embraces the family owned and operated business. Small antique shops; cute fruit stands; General Stores named after families who have    existed in the area for countless generations. This truly is a town where everybody say “mourning” and knows your name.</p><ul>    <li>        <p>            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sherrill-orchards-santa-ysabel">Sherrill Orchards</a>            - 30263 CA-78 - 760-765-1124.        </p>    </li>    <li>        <p>            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.donsmarketsantaysabel.com/">Don's Market</a>            - 30250 CA-78 - 760-765-3272.        </p>    </li>    <li>        <p>            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crossroadstreasures.biz/">Crossroads Treasures</a>            - 21952 CA-79 - 760-765-2530.        </p>    </li>    <li>        <p>            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sohosandiego.org/">Santa Ysabel General Store</a>            - 30275 Julian Rd - 760-765-1270.        </p>    </li>    <li>        <p>            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.santaysabelartgallery.com/">Santa Ysabel Art Gallery</a>            - 30352 CA-78 - 760-765-1676.        </p>    </li></ul><p>    <strong>Restaurants</strong></p><p>    Dining options in Sant Ysabel are limited.

They quickly    named the natives Lusieños (die to their proximity to Mision De San Luis Rey) and went about carving out the land on account of their conquest.</p><p>    After this period Carlsbad continued on a copied chronology similar to other hamlets of the area. First the Spaniards, then a couple ranch grab by the    Mexicans, with a finalized deed of land to a wealthy American.</p><p>    The main difference to Carlsbad’s tale came at the end of the 1880s lead by the hand of a sailor and soldier of fortune by the name John Fraizer. Fraizer,    desperate to make a living, dug a well in the area and started offering his water at the nearby train stop (the now aptly named Fraizer’s Station). The man    struck gold in the form of liquid ecstasy. It was discovered, after careful analysis, that the fresh water had an identical chemical compound as some of    the most renowned spas and springs in the world. The area’s fame blossomed. Marketing officials and a savvy city council quickly naming the town after the    legendary Spa in The Bohemian city of the Czech Republic, Karlsband.</p><p>    A consortium of mineral water companies was formed, and with it Carlsbad's fate was sealed: in less than a century the town has become a beacon vacation    spot.</p><p>    Within its borders, aside from Californian beaches, you'll uncover a LEGOLAND Resort, a couple of Skateparks (this is, after all, where skateboard legend    Tony Hawk made his bonafides) and a smashing airport.</p><p>    <strong>Weather</strong></p><p>    Carlsbad has a Semi-Arid Mediterranean Climate and averages 263 sunny days per year.

Its time was inspired by a small tidbit of its lackluster past. The area had been the cradle    for a dairy farm and monastery of the Carmelite Sisters of Mercy way back in the turn of the twentieth century, circa 1905.</p><p>    Carmel Valley is a surgically thought-out district with all the amenities and facilities you could ever need or want.

Del Mar, an    aptly if not too subtle or ingenious turn of the Spanish phrase “by the sea”, is an amazing community that first edged its way into existence back in 1885.</p><p>    Del Mar’s birth pangs and gestation came into being when cunning entrepreneur, Colonel Jacob Taylor purchased a 338 acre of seafront property from one    Enoch Talbert. The Colonel had a dream, a vehement vision engendering like a disembodied voice at the back of his brain. A broken floodgate of fantasy the    would ultimately be the prologue of this amazing little hamlet. The Colonel wanted to build a seaside resort for the rich and famous out by Del Mar’s    bluffs. A place for the affluent to seek comforts and solitude.</p><p>    That would be Del Mar’s fate, until the United States Navy started operating a Naval Auxiliary Air Facility for blimps, out of the city shores, during the    assault on Japan in the latter part of the Second World War. That feat of coastal fortification effectively plunged Del Mar into the limelight, and made a    proper city from its frame.</p><p>    Aside from its Coastal landscape and charming sceneries, Del Mar is also internationally known for two odd tidbits hidden in its roster of quaint    qualities. It is the host of the annually held Del mar racetrack and one of the few locations where Torrey Pine tree grows (the rarest of pine and one that    figures high on the endangered species list of flora).</p><p>    <strong>Weather</strong></p><p>    Del Mar's climate is considered mediterranean-subtropical. wWarm, dry summers and mild, humid winters, with stable summers. It is considered one of the    more desirable and fetching climates in the United sates.The average yearly temperature in Del Mar is approximately 65 °F.</p><p>    <strong>Recreation</strong></p><p>    With a name like Del Mar, you can imagine without, any prodding from anybody, what Del Mar’s main source of recreation is.

An odd little    town that manages to constantly have a fresh outlook on life. It never seizes to amaze or inspire.</p><p>    Oceanside</p><p>    A young vibrant community that was originally settled by Native Americans, Oceanside’s fortunes have turned from a rural seaside hamlet into a bustling    town with the a bright future on its horizon.</p><p>    The town has been passed around like spoils of wars since its inception in pre-colonial times. Tribes fought over its magnificent vistas, only to fell the    boot-heel of Conquistadors in the 18th century.

A great place to always feel young at heart and happily discover that age is only a state of mind.</p><p>    Rancho Santa Fe</p><p>    A community primarily composed of residential housing developments with a few shopping blocks, a middle and elementary school, and several restaurants,    Rancho Santa Fe is one of San Diego’s many satellite towns that serve as godsends and tranquil heavens for commuters.</p><p>    Rancho Santa Fe’s history dates back to a Post-Colonial Era as a Mexican ranch in Alta California. Nonetheless, its fascinating chronology amassed    excitement in the early stages of the twentieth century. In 1906, on this pivotal year, the Santa Fe Railway company purchased the entire land in order to    plant Blue gum eucalyptus trees; the normal shrubbery used in order to produce railroad ties.</p><p>    Sadly, once the saplings started edging into maturity, the company discovered that due to some genetic anomaly the wood proved to be far too soft and    pliable to hold fast to steel spikes. Their venture was on the brink of turning into a disaster.</p><p>    Then, with some incredible outside the box thinking, the Railway Company shifted gears and profession. They took off their conductor’s hat and donned the    vest of a real estate seller. In a couple of years they had transformed the town into coveted new community. A community with so much pull in the area,    that it actually managed to snatch Bing Crosby to annually host a celebrity golf tournament for over 10 years straight.</p><p>    <strong>Weather</strong></p><p>    The weather of Rancho Santa Fe has been defined as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate. A system that promotes mild winter and humid summers. Still, due to    its higher elevation and inland location, its local weather sometimes acts in erratic patterns. Notably, Rancho Santa Fe is one of only a few places in    suburban San Diego to receive snowfall, the last of which occurred on February 26–27, 2011</p><p>    <strong>Recreation</strong></p><p>    Rancho Santa Fe lives by the decree of work hard during the week and play harder during the weekend. It affluent community likes to spend its Monday to    Friday amassing fortunes and bringing home the bacon, all the while certain that their efforts will be payed off come their Sunday morning tee-time.

It largely sits on the bay itself and has    plenty of ocean and water views for anyone looking to get their sea legs. Apollo Beach is considered one of the best areas to retire for that reason, and    many more. Historically, Apollo Beach’s roots begin in 1923 when the land was owned by the Dickman family and was used for farming and grazing pasture. In    the 1930’s, Paul Dickman came up with the idea of a waterfront community. Over the years, Apollo Beach went through several major name changes as well as    engineering and construction changes via several engineering and electrical firms. After decades of struggle and work on the Apollo Beach project, it is a    thriving waterfront community today, and home to year-round boating, fishing and other general water activities.</p><p>    <strong>Weather</strong></p><p>    Apollo Beach experiences the typical Florida experience with high heats and high humidity stretching throughout the year.

There is an endless supply of    things to enjoy in Apollo Beach, whether it is with tasty restaurants, charming shopping opportunities, or the obligatory boating, you will never run out    of things to do. Apollo Beach does, in fact, have a dreamlike quality to it – it is the picturesque pinnacle of what most imagine life in Florida will be    like. The kids, teens and adults in your family can all find something to enjoy right from one of the many beautiful homes Apollo Beach has to offer.

If you want the Florida experience, Apollo Beach is    for you.</p><p>    Lithia</p><p>    Lithia is a beautiful suburb of Tampa Bay that has miles of stretching country and natural Florida beauty. Unlike Tampa Bay, Lithia is a quiet area that    posts some of the most gorgeous, natural sites you can find in the area, such as: Fish Hawk, the Chito Branch Reserve, and the Alafia River Corridor. Prior    to 1846, Lithia had been inhabited by several Native American tribes of varying name and faction, including: the Tocobaga, the Muskogan, the Tomkan, the    Caloose, and, later on, the Seminole. Settlers from George arrived in 1847, and in 1848 a man by the name of James Alderman created a ford on the Alafia    River where the present day Alderman’s Ford Park resides. Around 1900, lithium was discovered in the waters of a local spring, and thus the suburb got it’s    name. At present, Lithia is a perfect opportunity for those looking to settle into quiet, Floridian country while still having the conveniences of Tampa    Bay nearby.</p><p>    <strong>Weather</strong></p><p>    Lithia experiences the typical Florida experience with high heats and high humidity stretching throughout the year. Very rarely does the temperature drop    beneath fifty degrees Fahrenheit. The most humid months tend to be June through August, and the precipitation is noticeable. Lithia can also experience    heavy rainfall and occasional thunderstorms, which rarely leads to flooding from the nearby bodies of water.</p><p>    <strong>Recreation / Things To Do</strong></p><p>    Lithia is a phenomenal place to get out and experience some of nature’s finest. Whether it is riding a fan boat down the waterways, swimming with the    manatees, fishing or just enjoying the country in general, Lithia has a bounty of things to do. It is also quite easy to step outside of the country beauty    and right into Tampa Bay and its surrounding areas</p><ul>    <li>        <p>            Lithia Springs Park – 3932 Lithia Springs Rd – (813) 744-5572        </p>    </li>    <li>        <p>            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.snorkelwithmanatees.com/">Swim With the Manatees</a>            – 4155 S Suncoast Blvd – (352) 257-8687        </p>    </li>    <li>        <p>            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sarasotajunglegardens.com/">Sarasota Jungle Gardens</a>            – 3701 Bay Shore Rd – (941) 355-5305        </p>    </li>    <li>        <p>            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cponies.com/">CPonies</a>            – North Skyway I-275 – (941) 773-5196        </p>    </li></ul><p>    <strong>Shopping</strong></p><p>    Lithia has plenty in the way of down-home charm, with little mom-n-pop shops off the side of country roads dotting the area.

House-hunters and visitors alike are certain to find more than enough to enjoy in this little country    paradise.</p><p>    Riverview</p><p>    Riverview is an active area near Tampa Bay and in the Hillsborough County department. As of 2010, Riverview experienced explosive population growth in its    beautiful borders as well as major expansion of several major businesses and corporations. Many of the radio and television stations broadcast from an    antenna farm in the Riverview area, and it is also home to Bell Creek Natural Preserve. Riverview itself was founded in 1885 on the Alafia River to the    northern part of the shore. In the 1830s, however, settlers arrived on the southern portion of the river in an area known as Peru, named after the Indian    term for a straight part of a river. Peru existed for nearly one hundred years, and is considered on the oldest settlements in all of Central Florida. In    the 1940s, the settlement on the northern shore that was to become Riverview absorbed Peru and laid claim to the south side of the Alafia River.

What would become Valrico was originally a region of cotton plantations that was known back then as Long    Pond. With the arrival of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad in 1890, many new immigrants arrived from the north into the small area. A philosophy    professor from Tufts College known as William G. Tousey gave Valrico its current name, which is derived from a Spanish phrase that translates out to    “valley of gold”. At present, Valrico stands in Hillsborough county as a small treasure of suburb with all the beauty Florida has to offer in a mix of both    rural and residential neighborhoods meeting with convenient shopping, restaurants and fun things to do with the whole family dotting the area. Even with    the convenience of having Tampa Bay at your doorstep, Valrico is an area that many residents and visitors alike thoroughly enjoy experiencing and being a    part of.</p><p>    <strong>Weather</strong></p><p>    Valrico experiences the typical Florida experience with high heats and high humidity stretching throughout the year.
